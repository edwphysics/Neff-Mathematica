NEUTRINO DECOUPLING SOLVER - MATHEMATICA - RK4 METHOD

The NIDBasicModules.nb (NIDQEDBasicModules.nb) contains the constants, parameters and the definition of the functions and derivatives for the NID (NID+QED) case. 

The files with extension .m are packages created by the Basic Modules notebooks automatically and used by the numerical methods codes.

The notebook RK4.nb contains the implemented RK4 method to the neutrinos decoupling solution. If there is a crash, the BackUp.nb notebook runs the code RK4.nb starting where it failed.

To run the program just do
1. Open RK4.nb
2. Run the Notebook
3. Say yes when asked to run the initialization cells
4. Run the Results.nb notebook to obtain the results
