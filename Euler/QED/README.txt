NEUTRINO DECOUPLING SOLVER - MATHEMATICA

Stages:
	1. Non-instantaneous decoupling (NIDec)
	2. NIDec + QED Corrections
	3. QED Corrections

Details of the current program: Stage 3

- Using the Euler Method to solve the equations system. 
- Initial Conditions: Modern, from De Salas et al, 2016.
- Reference Mass: Electron mass me.

Results: N = 4000, z = 1.3997, Neff = 3.01164

Details of the calculation:

- Error probably due to the Euler Method
